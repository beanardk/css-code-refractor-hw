# CSS Code Refractor HW
Simplified/refracted HTML and CSS code for Horiseon website.

## Overview
I have updated the code to meet todays standards of HTML and CSS code making it more accesible and readable for other coders that plan on working on it in the future. I did this by updating the semantics and grouping things together in a more efficient and neater way that did not comprimise the existing look of the website.
